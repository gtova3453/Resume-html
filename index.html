    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <h3>1. Little Ceaser</h3>

    <p>
      My first ever job was a fast food job. Although it doesn't seem like a very
      good job, you've got to start somewhere.
      <br />
      I did nearly everything while working there except taking order so I had
      most of the hands on
      <br />
      experience.
    </p>
    <h3>Responsibilites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Being fast and efficient to make the orders on time for the customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to handle multiple orders at once while not getting
        overwhelmed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Making the right decision when to prepare the dough for the next orders
        when you are running low.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Ross</h3>
    <p>
      Once I was done with little Ceasar's I decided I wanted to try something
      different.
      <br />
      My second job I was a retail associate which was totally different than
      fast food.

        Be able to handle the fitting room (its a lot more work than it sounds)
      </li>
      <li>Restock all the unplaced items and the end of the day</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
